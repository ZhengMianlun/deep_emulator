Hereby we use the public library Vega FEM for compiling our two utility files. Please do as follow:
1. Download the Vega FEM library from http://barbic.usc.edu/vega/
2. Copy the "libraries" and "Makefile-headers" folders from Vega FEM into folder "deep_emulator/code/vega_FEM/".
3. Compile the utilities "interpolateData" and "textMatrix2Matrix" via Makefile.
