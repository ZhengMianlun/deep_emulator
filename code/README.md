Please run test.py to get roll-out prediction results. We've provided a pretrained weight file for you. There are two options for rendering the prediction results. Set flag to 'surface" means we directly render the surface results while flag "tet" represents volumetric results rendering.

If flag "surface" is selected, two utility files are needed (in vega_FEM) for interpolating the volumetric results to the surface results. Please refer to the folder vega_FEM for how to compile the two utility files.
