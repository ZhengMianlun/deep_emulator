Welcome to the deep emulator repository! 
This repository is for the CVPR 2021 oral paper "A Deep Emulator for Secondary Motion of 3D Characters".
We provided code for model building, training and testing. We also provided a pre-trained weight file for testing.

We've only tested our code on Ubuntu 16.04, with Python version: 3.8.3 and Pytorch version: 1.5.0.

For any problems, please contact the authors!

Thank you! :)
