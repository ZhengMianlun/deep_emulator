As described in our paper, we trained our deep emulator on the sphere dataset and then predicted on the character dataset. 

Since the sphere dataset is quite large, we here only show two examples. For full dataset, please contact the authors.

Below is description for each file in the dataset:
1. adj: the 1-ring neighbor vertex ID information for each local patch
2. c: the constraint information for each vertex
3. k: the stiffness (Young's modulus) information for each vertex
4. m: the mass information for each vertex
5. x_i: the displacement information of the primary (skinned) motion
6. u_i: the displacement information of the secondary motion
